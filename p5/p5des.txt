this video is a parody of tropes of the adventure genre of both video games 
and movies. It is meant to be a comical exploration of the often times 
ridiculous plot and logic of children's adventure stories. In which a 
princess must be saved by a prophesied legendary warrior who is 
still but a boy, waiting to become a hero. The aspect of this project 
that I'm happiest about it's actually the script and the story, since
I cannot take responsibility for the music. I have never 
written a comedy script or story before so I think this one turned out 
pretty nicely. Although, I think a few more revisions could've made 
vast improvements. And considering that it is a 22 minute long video, that 
was made in probably less than a week, frame by frame, I don't think the 
animation's half bad. Though I will say there is a lot of room for 
improvement. My biggest nemesis With this project was the timeframe, 
so I think a lot of these improvements I'm talking about would have vanished 
with more time. I had a really fun time making this.
