This video is gameplay of a puzzle game I created. 
The game was created using Processing, a java based language, and mostly found images.
The game itself consists of references to popular games, TV shows, and movies. 
In order to complete the game you must follow the direction given on screen for four 
different typs of puzzles. The only image I made was the "Eeveengers" poster in the 
"find the pokeball" puzzle, and I wish I had created more of the images myself 
rather than relying on found images from the Internet. I also wish I had added
background music and sound effects to the game. Still, I'm really happy with how 
this project turned out as a whole. This was the first game I coded entirely
on my own. I think it's a fun little game that works well.
