                <p>This project is a digital 3D model replica of a real life New York apartment 
interior, meaning that the model was created with the aid of photographs of 
a real apartment that I had never visited or seen in person. The intention 
of the work is to look as realistic as possible, while only using basic Maya 
modeling and texturing techniques. I am happy with the replication of 
complex shapes and details of the apartment as well as my ability to find and 
create high quality textures for those shapes. I did well in paying attention 
to the details of the photos that were available to me, which allowed me to 
create a detailed model. There are definitely a few things that could use 
improvement, though, like adding certain details to my models and texture. 
In the end it is these things that I wish to improve about this work that 
effected how I did my future work.</p>

				<p>This is a custom controller to be used to play video game ROMs on a computer, 
such as Pokémon Pinball for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced and Mario Kart for 
the N64. It uses simple contact point buttons connected to the Arduino 
Leonardo, which has the capability to mimic a computer keyboard and mouse. 
This controller is meant to be played with two people at time, splitting 
the controls between both people to try to create a collaborative situation 
in the single player game, though it can be used with one player or even 
three or more players. It has two tethered “pokéball” buttons on either 
side of the controller, which is held by each of the two players. 
I’m really proud of how this project turned out as a whole. The only thing 
I would do differently is change the length of the tethers so that the players 
could step further back from the screen for more space. This project is extra 
special to me because I was able to show it to other students and see them 
really enjoy my creation just like I hoped they would.</p>

            <p> This video is gameplay of a puzzle game I created. 
The game was created using Processing, a java based language, and mostly found images.
The game itself consists of references to popular games, TV shows, and movies. 
In order to complete the game you must follow the direction given on screen for four 
different typs of puzzles. The only image I made was the "Eeveengers" poster in the 
"find the pokeball" puzzle, and I wish I had created more of the images myself 
rather than relying on found images from the Internet. I also wish I had added
background music and sound effects to the game. Still, I'm really happy with how 
this project turned out as a whole. This was the first game I coded entirely
on my own. I think it's a fun little game that works well.</p>

            <p> This is a video of a 3d character that I modeled and animated on my own 
from start to finish. I'm happy with how the project turned out as a whole.
I think the character model and texture is clean and simple, and the 
animations look fluid and mostly natural. One thing I would improve is to add 
more details to the character, like weapon and accessories. I would also try 
to tweak the animation to see if I could get them to look any more realistic. 
The biggest thing this model taught me was the importance of clean UVs, which 
are actually very difficult to achieve and without which texturing would be 
impossible.</p>

            <p> this video is a parody of tropes of the adventure genre of both video games 
and movies. It is meant to be a comical exploration of the often times 
ridiculous plot and logic of children's adventure stories. In which a 
princess must be saved by a prophesied legendary warrior who is 
still but a boy, waiting to become a hero. The aspect of this project 
that I'm happiest about it's actually the script and the story, since
I cannot take responsibility for the music. I have never 
written a comedy script or story before so I think this one turned out 
pretty nicely. Although, I think a few more revisions could've made 
vast improvements. And considering that it is a 22 minute long video, that 
was made in probably less than a week, frame by frame, I don't think the 
animation's half bad. Though I will say there is a lot of room for 
improvement. My biggest nemesis With this project was the timeframe, 
so I think a lot of these improvements I'm talking about would have vanished 
with more time. I had a really fun time making this.</p>
