                <h1>Artist Statment</h1>
                <p>As someone who has worked with 3D modeling, animation, paper 
                and pencil, fabric and ink, clay, sculpture, and paint on canvas,
                 I have become fascinated with how art is perceived and how the 
                 medium affects our understanding of the work. In my art, I focus 
                 on prompting a change in perspective. I hope to open a portal to a 
                 new understanding and appreciation of the world around us by 
                 subverting expectations.

            <p> One of a Kind: A Textile Design Collection is a textile 
            design collection created using both hand-printed and digitally 
            printed designs on fabric. Textile design is something that we 
            encounter in everyday life. We look at these designs without a 
            second thought, never wondering what effort went into creating 
            these patterns. They are designs we see on our clothes, our bags, 
            and our beds. One of a Kind utilizes our familiarity with this 
            medium to explore the artistic side of textile design. By creating 
            designs with strong focal points, the viewer can focus on the work 
            as art rather than a simple pattern. Additionally, by using 
            familiar subject matters in the patterns, Wiggins draws her viewers 
            into the details of the designs, opening up a whole new level of 
            appreciation for the time and effort put into each aspect of the 
            collection.</p>

                <p>This project is a digital 3D model replica of a real life New York apartment 
interior, meaning that the model was created with the aid of photographs of 
a real apartment that I had never visited or seen in person. The intention 
of the work is to look as realistic as possible, while only using basic Maya 
modeling and texturing techniques. I am happy with the replication of 
complex shapes and details of the apartment as well as my ability to find and 
create high quality textures for those shapes. I think I did well paying attention 
to the details of the photos that were available to me, which allowed me to 
create a detailed model. There are definitely a few things that could use 
improvement, like adding certain details to my models and texture.

				<p>This is a custom controller to be used to play video game ROMs on a computer, 
such as Pokémon Pinball for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced and Mario Kart for 
the N64. It uses simple contact point buttons connected to the Arduino 
Leonardo, which has the capability to mimic a computer keyboard and mouse. 
This controller is meant to be played with two people at a time, splitting 
the controls between both people to try to create a collaborative situation 
in the single player game, though it can be used with one player or even 
three or more players. It has two tethered “pokéball” buttons on either 
side of the controller, which is held by each of the two players. 
I’m really proud of how this project turned out as a whole. The only thing 
I would do differently is change the length of the tethers so that the players 
could step further back from the screen for more space. This project is extra 
special to me because I was able to show it to other students and see them 
really enjoy my creation just like I hoped they would.</p>

            <p> This video is gameplay of a puzzle game I created. 
The game was created using Processing, a java based language, and mostly found images.
The game itself consists of references to popular games, TV shows, and movies. 
In order to complete the game, you must follow the directions given on screen for the four 
different typs of puzzles. The only image I made was the "Eeveengers" poster in the 
"find the pokeball" puzzle, and I wish I had created more of the images myself 
rather than relying on found images from the Internet. I also wish I had added
background music and sound effects to the game. Still, I'm really happy with how 
this project turned out as a whole. This was the first game I coded entirely
on my own. I think it's a fun little game that works well.</p>

            <p> This video is a parody of tropes of the adventure genre of both video games 
and movies. It is meant to be a comical exploration of the often times 
ridiculous plot and logic of children's adventure stories, in which a 
princess must be saved by a prophesied legendary warrior who is 
still but a boy, waiting to become a hero. The aspect of this project 
that I'm happiest about is actually the script and the story, since
I cannot take responsibility for the music. I have never 
written a comedy script or story before so I think this one turned out 
pretty nicely. Although, I think a few more revisions could've made 
vast improvements. Considering that it is a 22 minute long video, that 
was made in probably less than a week, frame by frame, I don't think the 
animation's half bad. Though I will say there is a lot of room for 
improvement. My biggest nemesis with this project was the timeframe.
I think a lot of these improvements I'm talking about would have vanished 
with more time. I had a really fun time making this.</p>
