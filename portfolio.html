                <p>This project is a digital 3D model replica of a real life New York apartment interior, meaning that the model was created with the aid of photographs of a real apartment that I had never visited or seen in person. The intention of the work is to look as realistic as possible, while only using basic Maya modeling and texturing techniques. Considering that this was the first model I created and textured in Maya on my own, I am happy with the replication of complex shapes and details of the apartment as well as my ability to find and create high quality textures for those shapes. I did well in paying attention to the details of the photos that were available to me, which allowed me to create a detailed model. There are definitely a few things that could use improvement, though, like adding certain details I omitted from the apartment because I couldn’t replicate them with my skill level at that time, or some of my textures could have been more detailed than they were. Mostly, I feel that the biggest improvement that I could make is simplifying how I went about creating certain shapes in the apartment, over-complicating the construction making it harder for me to adjust and texture them thereafter. In the end it is these things that I wish to improve about the work that effected how I did my future work. I have since improved and hope to improve even more with more practice.</p>

				<p>This is a custom controller to be used to play video game ROMs on a computer, such as Pokémon Pinball for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced and Mario Kart for the N64. It uses simple contact point buttons connected to the Arduino Leonardo, which has the capability to mimic a computer keyboard and mouse. This controller is meant to be played with two people at time, splitting the controls between both people to try to create a collaborative situation in the single player game, though it can be used with one player or even three or more players. It has two tethered “pokéball” buttons on either side of the controller, which is held by each of the two players. When used for pinball each button controls a flipper, and when used in something like Mario Kart each button controls a turn direction. I’m really proud of how this project turned out as a whole. The only thing I would do differently is change the length of the tethers so that the players could step further back from the screen for more space. This project taught me a lot about controller design and gave me a whole new appreciation for how console creators make their controllers. This project is extra special to me because I was able to show it to other students and see them really enjoy my creation just like I hoped they would.</p>
