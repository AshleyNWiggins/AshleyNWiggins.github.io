This is a custom controller to be used to play video game ROMs on a computer, 
such as Pokémon Pinball for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced and Mario Kart for 
the N64. It uses simple contact point buttons connected to the Arduino 
Leonardo, which has the capability to mimic a computer keyboard and mouse. 
This controller is meant to be played with two people at time, splitting 
the controls between both people to try to create a collaborative situation 
in the single player game, though it can be used with one player or even 
three or more players. It has two tethered “pokéball” buttons on either 
side of the controller, which is held by each of the two players. 
I’m really proud of how this project turned out as a whole. The only thing 
I would do differently is change the length of the tethers so that the players 
could step further back from the screen for more space. This project is extra 
special to me because I was able to show it to other students and see them 
really enjoy my creation just like I hoped they would.
