This is a video of a 3d character that I modeled and animated on my own 
from start to finish. I'm happy with how the project turned out as a whole.
I think the character model and texture is clean and simple, and the 
animations look fluid and mostly natural. One thing I would improve is to add 
more details to the character, like weapon and accessories. I would also try 
to tweak the animation to see if I could get them to look any more realistic. 
The biggest thing this model taught me was the importance of clean UVs, which 
are actually very difficult to achieve and without which texturing would be 
impossible.
